1. Introduction

Bachelor Thesis by Daniel Rembold
Institute of Institute of Computer Technology
Technical University of Hamburg


Part of my bachelor thesis is to compute and enumerate (degree compatible) Groebner bases given from a code Ideal
generated by linear Codes.

This software is adapted and edited by [1] for my special needs.

To be continued...

2. How to use the Software

The software is completely written in C and can be compiled with the given makefile.
Just open a console and go to the folder where CIDGEL is saved.
Then type in 'make', the program should be compiled and built now.

For a help message type in './cidgel -h'. This gives advices of the flags.

Example use: The software is compiled and built and it should be determined if the Groeberfan from
	     the given example 'Examples/example11' and 'Examples/example14' are compatible.
	     Then, the call should be './cidgel -i Examples/example11 -m Examples/example14'
