\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
Even if the algorithms are well suited for the given problems, this software can be improved.
The algorithms themselves may already have mathematically the best performance. 
Section \ref{subsec:compexp} shows that the computation of facets is the most expensive step, so the performance can be heavily improved by enhancing the linear programming.
The software uses a built-in LP solver mentioned in \cite{tigers}, but extern LP-solvers like the GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) could be more efficient. \\
The software package CaTS \cite{cats} enumerates all reduced Gr√∂bner bases for a lattice Ideal. CaTS uses an external LP-Solver too to improve the performance.
\\\\
Another approach will be parallelization of the computation of facets. To compute the facets, a certain amount of linear programs have to be set up, which can be solved independently. Every processor core of the computing unit can solve the linear programs.\\
If a LP solver is thread-safe, both ideas can be put together and lead to a large speedup.
