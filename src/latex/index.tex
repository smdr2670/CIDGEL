This software, called C\-I\-D\-G\-E\-L (Code Ideal degree compatible Groebner bases enumerating from Linear Codes), is a re-\/implementation of Ti\-G\-E\-R\-S, that is why the software is written in C. All features that are needed for the code ideals were added, also the adapted algorithms for computing degree compatible Groebner bases with reverse search and breath-\/first search were implemented.

C\-I\-D\-G\-E\-L was programmed and evaluated with Linux, so at first, it is needed to compile the software. The makefile is given and it only takes the console, moving to the direction of the folder and typing 'make'. All inputs, outputs, options and ags are passed with the command-\/line arguments. At First it is useful to run the program with the purpose to print the help-\/message only with the command ./cidgel -\/h.
